# Exploratory Analysis - Week 4

Branch by Joe Telafici

Included are six .R files, (plot1.R to plot4.R) and their corresponding output .png files (plot1.png to plot6.png).

NOTE: On my computer, some of the graphs fail to completely render in the Plots view of RStudio, sometimes with a warning that something "reached elapsed time limit".  The written .png file seems to be correct in all cases afterwards, as long as there were no actual errors.

I included Total and Mean emissions numbers as it was not clear from the data that there weren't simply more sources measured in 2008 vs. 1999 and therefore raw totals might hide this effect.
